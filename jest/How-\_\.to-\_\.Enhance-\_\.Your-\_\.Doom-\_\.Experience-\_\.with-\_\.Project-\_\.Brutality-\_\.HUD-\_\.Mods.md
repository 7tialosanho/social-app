In this article, we will show you how to install and use some of the best Project Brutality HUD mods available, and how they can improve your Doom experience. Whether you want a simple and clean HUD, a futuristic and immersive HUD, or a HUD that shows you all the information you need, there is a mod for you.
 
## What are Project Brutality HUD Mods?
 
Project Brutality HUD mods are addons that modify the way the game shows you information on the screen, such as your health, armor, ammo, weapons, inventory, keys, objectives, and more. They can also add new features and elements to the HUD, such as crosshairs, damage indicators, weapon icons, status effects, and more.
 
Project Brutality HUD mods are usually compatible with the latest versions of GZDoom and Zandronum engines, which are required to run Project Brutality itself. They are also easy to install and use: you just need to download the mod file (usually a PK3 or PK7 file) and load it after Project Brutality in your launcher of choice.
 
## What are the Benefits of Using Project Brutality HUD Mods?
 
Using Project Brutality HUD mods can enhance your Doom experience in many ways. Here are some of the benefits:
 
- You can choose a HUD that matches your playstyle and preferences. For example, if you like a minimalist and unobtrusive HUD, you can use Simple HUD Addons or HXRTC HUD 7.0 for Traditional Mode. If you like a more immersive and realistic HUD, you can use CatsVisor HUD or HXRTC HUD 7.0 for Project Brutality Mode. If you like a more informative and detailed HUD, you can use NC HUD or HXRTC HUD 7.0 for Classic Brutal Doom Mode.
- You can customize your HUD with various options and settings. For example, you can change the size, position, color, transparency, font, and style of the HUD elements. You can also toggle on and off certain features and elements of the HUD, such as crosshairs, damage indicators, weapon icons, status effects, and more.
- You can improve your gameplay performance and awareness with the help of the HUD. For example, you can see your health and armor levels at a glance, without having to look at the bottom of the screen. You can also see how much ammo you have left for each weapon type, without having to switch weapons. You can also see what items and keys you have collected, without having to open the inventory menu. You can also see what objectives you have to complete, without having to pause the game.

## How to Install and Use Project Brutality HUD Mods?
 
Installing and using Project Brutality HUD mods is very easy. Here are the steps:

1. Download the mod file (usually a PK3 or PK7 file) from the source of your choice. Some of the popular sources are Mod DB (https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons), Project Brutality Community Assets (https://projectbrutality.com/popular-community-addons/), or ZDoom Forums (https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=47539).
2. Extract the mod file to your Doom folder (the same folder where you have GZDoom or Zandronum executable).
3. Launch GZDoom or Zandronum with Project Brutality loaded first (you can use a launcher like ZDL or Doom Explorer to make this easier).
4. Add the mod file to your load order after Project Brutality (you can drag and drop it in your launcher or use command line parameters).
5. Start a new game or load a saved game with Project Brutality enabled.
6. Enjoy your new HUD!
